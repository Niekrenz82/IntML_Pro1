Run setup:

```{r}
source("setup/run_setup.R")
```

```{r}
summary(mv_data)
```

Removing all rows, with negative exposure. Where contract is terminated before renewal date:
```{r}
mv_data %>% 
  filter(Exposure < 0) %>% 
  select(Date_last_renewal, Date_lapse)

mv_data <- mv_data %>% 
  filter(Exposure >= 0)
```

Type_risk has a lot to say about length and Type_fuel are NA, which makes sense:

```{r}
mv_data %>%
  group_by(Type_risk) %>%
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    NA_Length = sum(is.na(Length)),
    NA_Type_fuel = sum(is.na(Type_fuel))
  )
```
