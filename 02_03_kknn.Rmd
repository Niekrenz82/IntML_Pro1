```{r}
knitr::knit(
  text  = readLines("01_01_EDA.Rmd"),
  quiet = TRUE,
  envir = globalenv()
)
```

Now we try to fit 4 different models on the data, first we setup the common task:
```{r}
task_imp <- as_task_regr(
  mv_data_imp,
  target = "Cost_claims_year",
  id = "mv_data",
)

task_imp$select(c("Distribution_channel","Seniority","Policies_in_force","Max_policies","Max_products","Payment","N_claims_history","R_Claims_history","Type_risk","Area","Second_driver","Power","Cylinder_capacity","Value_vehicle","N_doors","Type_fuel","Weight","Age","Age_driving_licence","Vehicle_age","Exposure", "ID"))

task_imp$set_col_roles("ID", "group")

task_imp
```
Setting up pipeline:
```{r}
# Define your encoding pipe
pipe_encode = po("encode",
  method         = "treatment",
  affect_columns = selector_type("factor")
)

# Helper to wrap any learner in your pipe
make_graph_learner = function(learner) {
  gl = pipe_encode %>>% learner
  GraphLearner$new(gl)
}
```


```{r}
# Common tuning components
resampling_inner   = rsmp("cv", folds = 3)
measure_mse        = msr("regr.mse")
tuner_rs           = tnr("random_search")
terminator_evals50 = trm("evals", n_evals = 2)

# 4) Auto‐tuners with the pipe in front

base_knn = lrn("regr.kknn", id = "knn")
gl_knn = make_graph_learner(base_knn)
search_space_knn = ps(
  knn.k = p_int(lower = 1, upper = 50)
)

at_knn = AutoTuner$new(
  learner      = gl_knn,
  resampling   = resampling_inner,
  measure      = measure_mse,
  tuner        = tuner_rs,
  terminator   = terminator_evals50,
  search_space = search_space_knn
)

gl_featless = make_graph_learner(lrn("regr.featureless"))
```

```{r}
# 6) Outer resampling & task
resampling_outer = rsmp("cv", folds = 3)
# 7) Benchmark setup & run
learners = list(at_knn, gl_featless)
design   = benchmark_grid(
  tasks      = task_imp,
  learners   = learners,
  resamplings = resampling_outer
)
bmr = benchmark(design)

# 8) Aggregate MSE results
bmr$aggregate(measure_mse)
```
